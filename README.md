# CTPCP 
## Codes
 
- You can tune parameters for `ctpcp.m` by `expRun.m`.
- Other helping funtions can be found in `methods/`
- Codes listed below for tensor operators are borrowed from [LibADMM](https://github.com/canyilu/LibADMM):

```
proximal_operator/
tensor_tools/
methods/trpca_tnn.m
```

## Documentation
- `admm_ctpcp/` explains the algorithm for solving CTPCP by ADMM in details.
- `tex/` contains original LaTeX files for the draft.
